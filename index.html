			<h2>Technical Advancement Groups (TAGs)<br />
				<small>or: (THE UNEXPECTED VIRTUE OF PASSIVE MEMBERSHIP)</small>
			</h2>
			<p>
				IEEE is excited to broadcast some new changes to the board for this upcoming year. The most common question we found ourselves being asked was: "How does one get involved with IEEE?". While there were plenty of opportunities to be involved in a committee (or several!), they got off to their start after the GM each semester, and then did their own thing. Trying to hop on the train midway throughout the semester proved difficult for many people, as it really demanded a lot of inner motivation. Effectively, we weren’t making the opportunity to get involved as seamless as possible, and that’s something we were determined to change.
			</p>
			<p>
				This problem particularly manifested itself in the technical branch, where the burden of knowing <em>everything</em> was shoved on the Technical Committee Directors. If we wanted to a workshop in a specific area – robotics, power, app dev, etc – it was on the director and his committee to become an instant expert on those topics to the level of which one could safely teach it to someone else. Rather than doing this, we developed a new method of creating our technical branch.
			</p>
			<p>
				The solution to this is Technical Advancement Groups – TAGs. We received lots of inspiration for this from the way ACM handles a similar situation with there SIGs, in case it wasn’t obvious to anyone. Each TAG is going to have a specific area of technical interest. Since there is no precedent here, we initially propose TAGs that are based on workshops or research groups. Some possible TAGs include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TAG-Circuits</li>
				<li>TAG-Power</li>
				<li>TAG-DSP</li>
				<li>TAG-RF</li>
				<li>TAG-Systems</li>
				<li>TAG-Robotics</li>
				<li>TAG-Controls</li>
				<li>TAG-PCB</li>
				<li>TAG-Soldering</li>
				<li>TAG-3D Printing</li>
				<li>Anything else! Got an idea? Run for it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Since this is the first year we’re doing this, the initial trial will be a bit different. We will interview for the TAG Directors like we would normal board officers. If sufficient interest is shown, and trust in the person leading is there, the TAG will be formed. 
				Our expectations are that the TAG will meet at minimum twice a month, and offer a variety of services. How the events are handled are obviously up to each individual group, but ideally we’d like to see workshops, lecture series, and for research focused ones, paper reviews. Not every meeting, but at least one each per semester. Hope you guys are excited about this as we are!
